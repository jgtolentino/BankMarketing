# README for JakeTolentino5P_BankMarketing.ipynb

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook, titled **JakeTolentino5P_BankMarketing**, provides a detailed analysis of a predictive model to enhance marketing effectiveness in targeting customers for subscription-based services. The primary goal is to develop data-driven approaches to increase subscription rates for term deposits at a bank.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this notebook comes from the **Bank Marketing Dataset** provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset is related to the direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification objective is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

- **Data Source**: [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing)
- **Dataset File**: `bank-full.csv`

## Key Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Description**: The notebook starts with cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure it is ready for predictive modeling. This involves dealing with missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature engineering, and scaling numerical data where necessary.
- **Techniques**: 
  - Handling missing data
  - Feature engineering
  - Data scaling and transformation

### 2. Predictive Model Development
- **Description**: The notebook develops several machine learning models to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.
- **Models Used**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient Boosting

### 3. Model Evaluation
- **Description**: The models are evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. The evaluation also includes cross-validation to ensure the generalization of the models.
- **Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - ROC-AUC
- **Cross-validation**: Used to validate the robustness of the model by testing it across multiple subsets of the data.

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Description**: Hyperparameter tuning is applied to improve the performance of the models. Techniques such as GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV are employed to find the optimal parameters for each model.
- **Techniques**:
  - GridSearchCV
  - RandomizedSearchCV
- **Visualization**: The notebook includes plots of model performance at different stages of optimization.

### 5. Ensemble Modeling
- **Description**: Two ensemble models, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, are implemented and compared against the baseline Logistic Regression model.
- **Models**:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- **Comparison**: The ensemble models are compared with logistic regression in terms of predictive power and overall performance.

### 6. Insights and Recommendations
- **Description**: The notebook provides actionable insights based on the model's results. It offers recommendations for marketing strategies that are informed by customer behavior and the likelihood of subscription.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Focus marketing efforts on customer segments most likely to subscribe
  - Allocate resources for high-potential customers identified by the model
  - Implement targeted communication strategies based on customer profiling

### 7. Continuous Model Monitoring
- **Description**: It is recommended to continuously monitor the model's performance over time. As customer behavior and market conditions change, the model should be retrained to remain relevant.
- **Action**:
  - Regular retraining and evaluation
  - Incorporating new customer data for better accuracy
